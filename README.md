# python-simulator
this repositary is about a python simulator, which is coded in python.
it is the first version available now.
the latest version is the v1.1, which includes special function
this is only a alpha version.



Edit in 2021: 
I've realized how stupid I was when I was 10, just 4 years ago.
 This was the simplest thing ever, just a simple wrapper around exec(), yet I put so much effort into it.

I have an unpublished version (which I can't find anymore), which had exception handlers for many exception. Then I realized found out that there were much more exceptions that I thought there were, and gave up.
